## Set up instructions ‚öôÔ∏è

### Install dependencies

- Install the following dependencies and frameworks:

  1. [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
  2. [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
  3. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

- Install node modules, run the following command on the main folder:

```
npm install
```

- Finally, start the development server by running one of the following commands:

```
npm start
expo start
```

- To access the API URL on Heroku, you will need to set up axiosConfig.sample. Once you have completed it, rename the file to axiosConfig.js which will be imported by the mobile app at the respective screens to access the API.

The sample code for the Heroku Express.JS app which serves as an API layer to the data in Salesforce is available here: [Github - Eureka Retail Server](https://github.com/terlim-sfdc/eureka-retail-server)
